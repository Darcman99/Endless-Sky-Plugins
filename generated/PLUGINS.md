| ![Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adde-Endless-Sky/AES-Fallen/master/icon.png) | [AES Fallen](https://github.com/Adde-Endless-Sky/AES-Fallen/archive/acedd0e39705c2283fedac098234b568e0e461a4.zip) | Darcy Manoel | A redesign of an old plugin that used to pop up from time to time way back when. Most of the outfits use the same stats, the ships will get new sprites, outfits might not. This is in no way a revival, it's just a small nod to an old plugin. |

They will not begin or turn hostile towards the player under normal circumstances, but you would be one unlucky pilot if you were to find yourself on bad terms with the Irm. |

This includes many new outfits and ships for various aspects of the vanilla game, even new missions here and there. |

It includes many opportunities to test balance or ship builds against AI driven ships or fleets, all vanilla content and the content of many plugins available to use to put together different ship builds. Many more tools are included into Omnis too! |
